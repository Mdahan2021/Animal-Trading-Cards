			<p>The giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck
and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its spotted coat patterns. It is classified
under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative, the okapi. Their food source is leaves, fruits, and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species, which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach.</p>
