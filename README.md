# Animal-Trading-Cards

This is the first project in "Udacity's Introduction to Programming" course.

In this project, I designed a trading card that features a giraffe. This card is designed as an html page having 
an image and some information about the animal (giraffe). The html file is supported by CSS file for styling the 
html page.
